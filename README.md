# 🌍 Ubuntu Image Fetcher

**“I am because we are.” – Ubuntu Philosophy**

The Ubuntu Image Fetcher is a simple Python tool that lets you **download and organize images** from the web in the spirit of community, respect, and sharing.  

It uses the power of Python libraries (`os` and `requests`) to create a safe space where fetched images are stored for later appreciation.
